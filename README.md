##DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT--
ETL Pipeline for Car Dataset – Data Preprocessing & Transformation
    This project involves an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to preprocess a car dataset. The pipeline includes data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical data,     and standardizing numerical features for better model performance.
The following libraries are used in this ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for data preprocessing and transformation:
    pandas – For data manipulation, handling missing values, and converting data types.
    numpy – For numerical operations and handling NaN values.
    matplotlib.pyplot – For visualizing boxplots of numerical columns to detect outliers.
    seaborn – For creating a heatmap to analyze feature correlations.
    sklearn.preprocessing – Includes:
                            StandardScaler() for feature scaling.
                            LabelEncoder() for encoding categorical variables.
This ETL process successfully prepares the dataset for machine learning by:
    Converting object data types to numeric.
    Handling missing values efficiently.
    Identifying and retaining outliers where necessary.
    Encoding categorical variables.
    Scaling numerical features for better comparability.
